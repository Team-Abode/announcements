### Team Abode is narrowing its content span
Over quite some time, the team has been considering switching back to making content **solely** for Fabric. The reason behind this change is due to the severe burnout many of the team experienced. We ultimately decided that we should stick with what we know best, and what makes developing fun, to begin with.

This decision may seem weird, but I hope you can all understand. Instead of finding ways to implement a feature on two platforms, we can allocate more development time to making our mods even better!

### Cave Enhancements is being deprecated... sorta.
Cave Enhancements will no longer be updated to 1.20, it will remain on Forge and Fabric on 1.19.2. Excluding the last patch that was released a couple weeks ago, this mod will no longer receive any updates. As a team, we feel Cave Enhancements may start to feel isolated after we start releasing more mods, as its roots and features are from a completely different era.

Lithoscape is a new project, which plans on bringing over certain Cave Enhancements features, polishing their design to be up to standards. Some notable features are:

* The removal of the Rose Quartz Caves, with another cave biome replacing it. Rose Quartz will still exist, but it won't have its own cave biome.
* Several features being revamped to have improved mechanics.
* Brand new exciting features!

### Verdance
Verdance is a new mod which implements features to the overworld, such as biomes, mobs, blocks, and quality of life tweaks. The initial release will contain three new biomes:

* The Shrublands, a new arid biome containing shrubs, a new structure, and cantaloupe!
* Mulberry Forest, containing a new woodset, along with a new mob!
* Tide Pools, the details about this biome are still a secret.

Verdance isn't solely focused on adding biomes, but we felt this would be a great highlight! Showcases of Verdance are coming really soon, so be tuned!

### Guarding
Guarding has received a nice rework that makes it more focused on gameplay, rather than configurability. There's still a good level of configurability, but it has changed it's focus on a vanilla styled expansion of shields.
The next update should see the Netherite Shield going out of experimental, so stay tuned for showcases!

### Release
Lithoscape, Verdance, and Guarding will not release on 1.19.2 or 1.19.4. They are estimated to be ready on the 1.20 versions. Overall, we will always prioritize releasing these when they are ready.
Guarding is an exception, it should be ready to release really soon, depending if 1.20 doesn't bring any major breaking changes.
